## [↑](#table-of-contents)Overview
A group of friends (~2-6 players) check into an old hotel in the middle of nowhere. I don’t have a very clear idea of what happens after that, 
but they eventually realize that they’re locked inside and there are no other living humans in there except for them (perhaps they are locked in their hotel rooms and hear strange noises outside?). 
To find their way out they have to solve riddles and puzzles in different hotel rooms to find the next clue leading them closer their escape, all the while being chased by **insert creature(s) here**.
The puzzles are often physical and require multiple people to solve. If the players are too slow, the **creature** catches up with them and it’s game over. The horror element should rely mainly on atmosphere, visuals, and enemy threats, not so much pitch-black darkness and jump scares.  

Players may be separated from the rest of the group. It’s not guaranteed all players will make it out alive (dead players may be turned into “ghosts” that can help the remaining players by seeing/walking through solid objects and relaying the info they gather that way to the other players, such as where a key is located). 

Solving a puzzle can give the players a key, a written clue, a helpful object, or other such things. There is also potential for visual storytelling here. 

Realistic graphics. Or at least semi-realistic.

## [↑](#table-of-contents)Mechanics
You mostly just interact with objects (open doors, unlock boxes, pick up items, etc.), run and crouch. A mechanic could also be implemented that measures how loud the players’ voices are – if they scream or shout they might give away their whereabouts to the **creature**, giving them less time to complete their current task.
