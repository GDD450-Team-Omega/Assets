> Premise: Work as a mad scientist’s assistant to pay off your student debt!
## [↑](#table-of-contents) Genre
#### ` Mini-Game ` ` Point n' Click ` ` Puzzle ` ` Platformer `

## [↑](#table-of-contents) Overview
The game is made up of several mini-games, which are all inspired by tasks an assistant to a mad scientist could have in their job description (“feed the lab rabbits”, “test the death ray”, “pull the lever”, etc.). You should try to do all your tasks to the best of your ability, so that you might get a raise and pay off your student debt faster. The goal of the game is to pay off your debt and find a better job. You lose if you die or get severely injured as a result of your workplace’s multiple OSHA violations.

Every day you get a to-do list by your employer, Dr. Dingsbums. Finish all the items on the list to earn your pay and proceed to the next day. Every month(?) you have an opportunity to negotiate your salary (special mini-game). You can also get help and tips from the retired lab rabbit Harrington still living in the tower, if they’re feeling generous. You might be able to bribe them with certain items.

The art style is very cartoony and exaggerated in both form and color. It’s almost claymation-like. Squash and stretch.
