## [↑](#table-of-contents) Overview

These enemies come in large waves over 3d slides and other such lines weirdness. These enemies are trojan horses. Each enemy houses a smaller weaker enemy or does something interesting on death. (Thing of better idea)

Certain maps have strangeness. Like one map styles have “random” teleporters the player has to deal with.
To prevent the enemy form reaching your base you place allies/buildings/creatures that will attack passing enemies and destroy them. 

Base is upgradable to add replay ability and uniqueness. Ie Make a few different play styles 
Base gives you tiles or ramps or something and you build the map like dorf 
Maybe tiles give resources, bases give tiles per round. 
Tiles make the level. Maybe combo tiles do things 
Decided between tiles that having lanes or the ai decides where it wants to go and you can make the land based on what you have seen. 

Slower pace tower defense game relaxing look at the scenery maybe super artsey art style
