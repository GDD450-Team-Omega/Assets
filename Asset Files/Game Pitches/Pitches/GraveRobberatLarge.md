## [↑](#table-of-contents)Overview
Gameplay consists of snatching bodies from graveyards and selling as many of them as possible at the highest possible prices. That said, there’s a lot more to it than that. You have to keep track of which graves are fresh, make sure you have the right tools and contacts. There are also traps and other anti-body snatching contraptions to look out for in the dark. Most important of all – don't get seen! 

There’s potential for co-op here: two people are better at moving corpses than one. 

3rd person view (possibly top-down). Not necessarily realistic art style, but should be a bit “rough” or “dark” (think *Darkest Dungeon* or *Don’t Starve* vibes). 
## [↑](#table-of-contents)Game Inspiration
- The real history of resurrectionists in 18th/19th century England 
- Grave Robber at Large by Creature Feature
- Various job simulation games 

## [↑](#table-of-contents)Mechanics
- You start out with simple tools in a lower-class graveyard. You can dig up fresh corpses (the dirt is still loose) that aren't protected by traps or other anti-grave robbery contraptions.
- Digging up corpses is the main gameplay element and you can only do this during the night - the night is 4(?) in-game hours long.
- To see properly you must make sure your lantern doesn't run out of oil. If it does, you must end the night early.
- There are some passersby, avoid being seen by them. If you're seen, you cannot return to the graveyard the following night and there will be security there for one week.
- If you're seen by security, it's game over.
- You must cover your tracks. If someone suspects someone has been messing with the graves, security will be at the graveyard for one week.
- In the beginning, you can sell the corpses you dig up to one established client. Make sure your wares are in acceptable condition - the fresher, the better! This is reflected in the price.
- As you earn more money you can buy new tools. Tools can help you disarm traps and avoid anti-grave robbery conrtraptions in the form of mini-games (think the hacking mini-game in *Bioshock*). Tools can also let you open tougher caskets and dig through denser dirt.
- You can also buy carriages. Carriages allow you to travel to more graveyards and carry more corpses. Typically, the more corpses a carriage holds, the slower it is.
- When you have several graveyards to choose from, you can start keeping track of when and where people are buried to maximize your route and get as many fresh corpses as possible. You can also avoid a specific graveyard if you were seen in it, thus not losing a whole night's income and even avoiding security altogether if you don’t return to the graveyard in question for a whole week.
- With enough money you can also hire underlings to do various tasks for you/alongside you.
- As you talk more to your client they can point you in the direction of other people who may be interested in your wares (a carriage is typically needed to reach these new clients).
- Clients may have special requests that will earn you more money than usual if you manage to deliver.
- You can earn extra money by stealing and selling valuable items you find in the graves you dig up, such as jewelry.
- Upper-class graveyards are typically harder to steal from, but what you find in the graves is usually worth your while (more unique corpses, more valuable grave goods).
- Do you want to steal more of the less valuable corpses, or just a few valuable ones?
- Seasons and weather impact your work - the summer heat makes corpses rot faster and the cold of winter makes it harder to dig. Rain is just bad news all year 'round.
